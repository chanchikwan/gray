Massive parallel ODE integrator written in CUDA C/C++
=====================================================

The "geode" code is a massive parallel ordinary differential equation
integrator that employs the "stream processing paradigm".  It is
designed to efficiently integrate billions of photons in curved
spacetime according to Einstein's general theory of relativity.  The
key component of the code is an adaptive scheduler that intelligently
rearrange the photons to reduce process idle time while maintaining
memory locality.  The code is implemented in CUDA C/C++.
